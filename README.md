# New Hue Restoration + Design Website

This project showcases a complete redesign of a website for a contracting company specializing in Restoration and Design. The original site faced significant challenges, including poor SEO, low user-to-customer conversion rates, and an outdated design that failed to reflect the company’s expertise.

# Goals and Solutions

To address these issues, I developed a modern, responsive website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Below are the key features and improvements:

# Enhanced SEO

* Implemented best practices for search engine optimization, including:

* Structured metadata

* Optimized page load speeds

* Schema markup

* Improved search engine rankings to drive organic traffic.

# Improved Conversion Rates

* Designed an intuitive user interface with:

* Clear call-to-action buttons

* Streamlined navigation

* Ensured responsive layouts to enhance the user experience across all devices.

# Modern Design

* Created a visually appealing and professional design to highlight the company’s restoration and design expertise.

* Incorporated engaging visuals and consistent branding to leave a lasting impression on users.

# Scalability

* Built a scalable architecture to support future growth.

* Enabled the easy addition of new features as the company evolves.
